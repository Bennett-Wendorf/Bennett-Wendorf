I'm Bennett, a student and programmer in Wisconsin, USA.

When I'm not working on projects for school or work, I enjoy messing around wth my Arco Linux system and working on projects I think are fun.

I'm especially interested in topics including AI and machine learning, but I also enjoy automation.
